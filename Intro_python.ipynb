    "Python is one of the most versatile and popular programming language with so many use cases. It is a high-level, general-purpose programming language and can be used for:\n",
    "* web development: Creating websites and web applications.\n",
    "* machine learning:  Implementing algorithms and models\n",
    "* web scrapping: Extracting data from websites.\n",
    "* software development: Building software and applications.\n",
    "* data analysis, etc.\n",

    " In this lesson, we'll cover the fundamental building blocks of Python, including variables, data types, String manipulations, e.t.c. As you progress, you'll gain the essential skills required to write Python programs and delve into practical examples that emphasize its significance in data science.\n",

    "Variables in python are like containers used to store information. \n",
    "naming conventions  in python includes:\n",
    "* Snakecase: Words are delimited by an underscore. (`variable_one`, `variable_two`).\n",
    "* Camelcase: Words are delimited by capital letters, except the initial word. (`variableOne`, `variableTwo`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a variable in python is straightfoward. It entails using \"`=`\" called the assignment operator to assign a value. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several rules to follow when naming variables in python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They cannot start with a number.\n",
    "- They must start with a letter or an underscore.\n",
    "- They can contain letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and underscores.\n",
    "- Variable names are case-sensitive (\"`aVar`\" and \"`avar`\" are different).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various data types in python. Some common data type includes:\n",
    "* Integers (int): Whole numbers, e.g., `-7`, `6`, `100`.\n",
    "* Floats (float): Numbers with decimal points, e.g., `7.14`, `5.718`.\n",
    "* Strings (str): strings are sequences of characters, and each character in a string has an index associated with it. The first character has an index of 0, the second has an index of 1. They are defined using quotation marks, e.g., \"`Hello, World!`\", \"`rice`\".\n",
    "* Booleans (bool): Represents `True` or `False`.\n",
    "* Lists: Ordered collections of items, e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.\n",
    "* Tuples: Similar to lists but immutable (cannot be changed), e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`.\n",
    "* Dictionaries: Key-value pairs, e.g., `{'name':\"temi\", 'age': 25}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this lesson, we will be focusing majorly on Integers, Floats, Strings, and Booleans.\n",
    "Python allows you to check the type of a variable using the `type()` function.\n",
